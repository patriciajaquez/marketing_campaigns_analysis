![Dashboard Banner](./img/banner_marketing_dashboard.png)

Final project for **Module 1** of the **Data Analyst & AI Bootcamp** at Upgrade Hub.

This project analyzes a dataset from a marketing campaign to uncover insights about customer behavior, product preferences, and campaign effectiveness. It includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and basic feature engineering, following best practices in data analytics.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on customer and campaign data.
- Identify **key trends** and **segmentation opportunities**.
- Apply **data visualization** techniques to communicate findings clearly.
- Draw **actionable insights** to support marketing decision-making.

## 🖼️ Dashboard Banner Image

The banner was generated using AI (DALL·E) with the following prompt:
A dashboard-style layout with dynamic marketing analytics displayed against a dark backdrop, featuring charts and graphs in vibrant shades of blue, orange, green, and teal. Includes pie chart, donut chart, bar graphs, and line graph. Clean and modern design.

To generate a similar image:
- Use [DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e) or a Stable Diffusion interface.
- Set your aspect ratio to **landscape** or **wide**.
- Include keywords like “dashboard”, “marketing analytics”, and “data visualization”.
- Add `no text` or `no labels` to avoid unwanted text in the image.
